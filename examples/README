README for Net::SSLeay::OO examples
-----------------------------------
Currently the examples in this directory are ... well, sparse.

I prefer examples in the form of tests which are actually run at to
verify that new changes work, rather than example scripts which IME
tend to bit-rot.

However there are a number of examples that come with Net::SSLeay, and
by and large they should be relatively easy to port to Net::SSLeay::OO.
All of the examples in the Net::SSLeay distribution are included in
the git source, but only the ones finished are included in the
MANIFEST and shipped with the distribution.

Should you find one in there you like, and feel inclined to port it to
the new API, then please do and submit it for inclusion with the main
module.  Submitting a change for this project is as simple as forking
it on github, making signed-off commits and then sending a pull
request!

Enjoy,
Sam Vilain.
