README for Net::SSLeay::OO
==========================

This package is a wrapper for the Net::SSLeay module on CPAN.
There is a good deal of blurb about it on its man page - go there for
the details!


Installing
----------
The application is designed to be installed like a CPAN module; so use
the usual:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  sudo make install

The CPAN module dependencies will be highlighted during the first
command. If you do not have 'sudo' installed, you can use:

  su root -c make install


Dependencies
------------
Other than Net::SSLeay, the principle dependency of this module is
Moose.  It may be possible to get the module working using Mouse; if
you can get it to do so and still pass the test suite, please send a
patch.

Note that the test suite requires the 'openssl' CLI to be installed,
otherwise the t/certs/make-test-certs.sh script will fail at
'Makefile.PL' stage.


Patching
--------
Please see the file SubmittingPatches for information.
